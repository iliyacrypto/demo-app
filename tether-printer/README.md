## Moralis Setup

You'll need a Moralis APP ID and Server URL. Create a new Moralis Server instance. You'll find
the APP ID and URL by pressing the "View Details" button. Fill in your values in the provided locations
at the top of `index.js`:

```javascript
Moralis.initialize("YOUR APP ID");
Moralis.serverURL = "YOUR SERVER URL";
```

## RealTime Event Plugin Setup

This demo is another example of tracking contract events, this time for when Tether prints new tokens.

Add a new "RealTime Event" plugin to your Moralis Server and enter the following info:
```
description : Tether Issue
topic : Issue(uint256)
address : 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7
tableName : IssueEvent
```
